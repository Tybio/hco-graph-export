# hco-graph-export

hco-graph-export contains a set of scripts designed to export Cisco HCO Topologies into graph formats.

This is an experimental project, currently the only option is to create a json for networkx that contains L1 and/or L3 topolgoeis.  These topologies are not linked at this time.

This is a work in progress and will likely not work for anyone, even the author!
